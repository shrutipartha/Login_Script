I have created the scripts for the login page in UFT , i have attached the Object Repository and Function Lib for the same.
Please import the script along with Object repository and function lib (u need to change the path of the datafile in the 2 actions based on the path that is stored)
As per the test case , we need to change the test data and the script would work.

Below are test cases for which i have created the test script (we can change the details based on the test case)
1. Create a New Account
   Expected Result: Sucessfully create a new account
2. Try to click on the create New Account for existing email id 
   Expected Result : An authentication message would be shown and would go ahead and sign in into the email address
3. Sucessfully Sign in with the email id and password.
 Excepted Result: The sign in should be sucessful
4. Unsucessfully Sign In with the email id and password (this is to assume the password is wrong)
   Expected Result : Authentication failure message would be displayed and click on the forgot password link and sucessfully send the link to the email id.
5. Sucessfuly Log out to check for another user , incase already logged in (while sign in)
   Expected Result: Sucessfully log out.
